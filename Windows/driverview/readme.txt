Using The DriverView Utility
============================

This utility is a standalone executable, so it doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. Just run the executable
(driverview.exe) and start using it. There is only one exception: If you
want to run this utility on Windows NT, you should download the
'psapi.dll', and copy it into the system32 folder.

The main window of DriverView utility displays the list of all loaded
drivers on your system. You can select one or more drivers from the list,
and then copy the details of these drivers to the clipboard, save them to
text or HTML file, or watch them as HTML report in your browser.
In addition, you can change the order of the columns in the drivers table
by dragging them to the desired position, or by using the 'Choose
Columns' dialog-box.

/stab <Filename>

/scomma <Filename>

This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting

The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Address" and "File Type". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~Driver Name") if you want to sort in descending order. You can
put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
DriverView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\drivers.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
DriverView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\drivers.html" /sort "File Type" /sort
"Driver Name"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.
